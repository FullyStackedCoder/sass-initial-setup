# My SASS Initial Project Setup

A simple skeleton project for SASS following the 7-1 rule for architecture.

### Dependencies
Install live-server globally for the dev server to work as intended.
Below you will find other packages for running the dev server, compiling sass to css and for helping with the final build process.
```
"autoprefixer": "^9.4.3",
"concat": "^1.0.3",
"node-sass": "^4.11.0",
"npm-run-all": "^4.1.5",
"postcss-cli": "^6.1.0"
```

### How to use?

1. Clone this project somewhere you like.
2. Run - npm install - for installing the required packages.
3. Run the command - npm start - to start the dev server and watch for changes in SASS and compile them when required.
4. You can add your css styles in individual files. Don't forget to import those partial files into main.scss
